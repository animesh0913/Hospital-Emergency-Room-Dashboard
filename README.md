# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard – Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Emergency Room (ER) performance data to identify operational inefficiencies, patient distribution patterns, and service quality indicators.

The objective of this analysis is to help hospital management improve patient flow, reduce wait times, and enhance overall patient satisfaction.

## Business Problem

Emergency rooms often face high patient inflow, leading to:

- Long waiting times
- Delayed patient attendance
- Uneven department workload
- Resource allocation challenges

This dashboard provides data-driven insights to support operational decision-making.

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Total Patients:** 9,216  
- **Average Wait Time:** 36.67 minutes  
- **Average Satisfaction Score:** 4.72 / 5  
- **Admission Rate:** 46% admitted, 54% not admitted  
- **Delayed Attendance:** 61% patients experienced delay  

## Dashboard Insights

### 1. Patient Attendance Analysis
- 61% of patients were attended with delay.
- Indicates operational bottlenecks in emergency handling.

**Recommendation:**  
Increase staffing during peak hours and implement improved triage prioritization.

### 2. Gender Distribution
- 49% Female
- 51% Male

Patient inflow is evenly distributed across genders.

### 3. Age Group Analysis
Highest patient group:
- 60–69 years (73 patients)

This suggests higher emergency usage among older individuals.

**Recommendation:**  
Introduce specialized geriatric emergency support services.

### 4. Department-wise Analysis
Most visits fall under:
- "None" (general entry cases)
- General Practice

This indicates ER is functioning as a primary care entry point for many patients.

**Recommendation:**  
Improve initial screening and patient routing to reduce unnecessary ER load.
